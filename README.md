Some original songs.

Songs generated from MIDI from Musescore and Bitmidi and Online Sequencer and elsewhere.
Songs converted using https://github.com/RaphiMC/NoteBlockTool and https://github.com/OpenNBS

Organized some songs from the following repositories:
https://github.com/TheInfamousAlk/nbs
https://github.com/nickg2/NBSsongs
https://github.com/thatcraniumguy/Songs
